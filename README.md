[^paperclip]:  
    The infamous Paperclip Maximizer:  
    The Paperclip Maximizer is a thought experiment described by Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom in 2003. It illustrates the existential risk that an artificial general intelligence may pose to human beings if it is successfully designed to pursue even seemingly harmless goals. The scenario describes an advanced AI tasked with manufacturing paperclips.0 The paperclip maximizer is an example of instrumental convergence, which suggests an AI could seek to fulfil a harmless goal in harmful ways from the human point of view. Harnessing a true AI to simple, seemingly innocent tasks could pose existential risk to humans if we don't safely know how to make a machine value human life.1
